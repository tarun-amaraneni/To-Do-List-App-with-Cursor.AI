# Project Development Reflection

## Development Process

The To-Do List application was developed in several iterations, with each commit representing a step in the development process:

1. **Initial Version (Basic Functionality)**
   - Prompt: "Create a basic To-Do List application in Python with the following features:
     - Add tasks to the list
     - View all tasks
     - Simple command-line interface
     - Store tasks in memory"
   - Result: Basic functionality with add and view features
   - Commit: "Initial commit: Basic To-Do List app with add and view functionality"

2. **Feature Enhancement (Task Management)**
   - Prompt: "Enhance the To-Do List app to include:
     - Mark tasks as complete
     - Delete tasks
     - Error handling for invalid inputs"
   - Result: Added task completion and deletion features
   - Commit: "feat: Add task completion and deletion functionality with error handling"

3. **Persistence Implementation (with Bug)**
   - Prompt: "Add task persistence to the To-Do List app:
     - Save tasks to a JSON file
     - Load tasks on startup
     - Handle file operations"
   - Result: Added persistence with a bug in file handling
   - Commit: "feat: Add task persistence - tasks are now saved between sessions"

4. **Bug Fix**
   - Prompt: "Fix the file handling bug in the To-Do List app:
     - Handle missing file case
     - Handle corrupted JSON data
     - Add proper error messages"
   - Result: Fixed file handling and added error recovery
   - Commit: "fix: Handle missing tasks file and corrupted JSON data"

5. **Test Integration**
   - Prompt: "Add unit tests to the To-Do List app:
     - Test basic operations (add, view)
     - Test task completion
     - Test task deletion
     - Test error handling"
   - Result: Integrated comprehensive unit tests
   - Commit: "test: Integrate unit tests for all core functionality"

## Code Refinements

Several refinement prompts were used to improve the code:

1. "Add proper error handling for invalid task numbers"
2. "Improve the user interface with better formatting"
3. "Add comments to explain the code logic"
4. "Ensure proper cleanup of test files"

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Breaking down features into manageable chunks
   - Testing each feature before moving to the next
   - Handling bugs as they arise

2. **Error Handling**
   - Proper validation of user input
   - Graceful handling of file operations
   - Clear error messages for users

3. **Testing**
   - Importance of unit tests
   - Test-driven development approach
   - Testing edge cases and error conditions

4. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Proper documentation
   - Maintainable code structure
